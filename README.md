Uses the CrewAI model to research about Riot Games as a company :D

Requirements: 
- API Key for a LLM (I used OpenAI for my example)
- Latest version of Python (I can't remember what the oldest version you can run this on but preferably the latest version)
- Option: Serper API Key (This API allows your AI Agent to search the web through Google searching)
  - Why? Some LLMs may not have the proper data from their training sets to be able to produce relevant data.
